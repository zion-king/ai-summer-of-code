It is ideal for maintaining the contextual integrity of the text, as sentences usually represent complete thoughts.\n","*   Regex Splitter: This method uses regular expressions to define custom split points. It offers the highest flexibility, allowing users to split documents based on patterns specific to their use case.\n","*   Markdown Splitter: This method is tailored for markdown documents.

It explains the reasons for this decision, citing numerous grievances against King George III, including his dissolution of elected representative bodies, refusal to allow new elections, and imposition of laws without the consent of the colonies. The document is a significant historical record outlining the principles of self-determination and individual rights, which have greatly influenced the development of democratic governments around the world.\n","AISoC RAG :  The text provided is a part of the United States Declaration of Independence, specifically the section where the representatives of the United States of America are addressing the British people. The representatives have tried to reason with the British, warning them about the unjust actions of their legislature and reminding them of the circumstances of American emigration and settlement. However, these attempts have been unsuccessful, leading to the necessity of separation. The representatives declare the United States' separation from Britain and announce that they will hold the British as enemies in war and friends in peace. The fundamental character of a tyrant, displayed by the British, makes them unfit to rule a free people.\n","AISoC RAG :  The text is a comparison between the original Declaration of Independence and its printed version by John Dunlap. The comparison is made by a person from the Department of State who had the original document in their custody. The original document does not have breaks, but dashes are used to separate thoughts. The printed version, which is inserted in the copy, has paragraphs, and the comparison follows this arrangement. The Declaration states that the tyrannical character of the British ruler makes him unfit to rule a free people, and the Americans have tried to reason with their British brethren before deciding to separate.\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["\n","KeyboardInterrupt\n","\n"]}],"source":["print(f\"{yellow}---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n","print(f'Welcome to the {chatbot_name}.
